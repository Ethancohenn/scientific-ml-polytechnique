# PC5 – Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This notebook is the fifth practical assignment of *Machine Learning for Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis*. It implements PINNs in TensorFlow to solve both elliptic and parabolic PDEs.

## Topics Covered

- **Autodiff**: TensorFlow `persistent` vs. `watch`, gradient computation 

- **PINN Setup**: network class, 1D/2D collocation grids  

- **Elliptic PDEs**: Poisson & constant‑coefficient problems  

- **Parabolic PDEs**: Heat & Allen–Cahn equations  

- **Lecture Questions Answers**: See `pc5_lecture_questions_answers.pdf`
