# PC2 – Supervised Learning with Neural Networks

This notebook is the second assignment of the course *Scientific Machine Learning for Numerical Analysis*. It explores the fundamentals of artificial neural networks and how to train them via stochastic optimization.

## Topics Covered

- **Shallow MLPs (single hidden layer)**  
  - Forward pass implementation  
  - Backpropagation derivation & code  
  - Training via gradient descent

- **Deep MLPs (multiple hidden layers)**  
  - Generalized forward/backward pass  
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (mini‑batch)  
  - Hyperparameter studies:  
    - Effect of number of neurons per layer  
    - Influence of depth (number of hidden layers)  
    - Impact of dataset size  
    - Impact of batch size
