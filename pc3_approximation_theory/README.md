# PC3 – Neural Network Approximation Theory

This notebook is the third practical assignment of the course *Machine Learning for Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis*. It explores how shallow networks can approximate basic functions and analyzes convergence rates in Sobolev spaces.

## Topics Covered

- **Function approximation with networks**  
  - Construction of “hat” basis functions  
  - Approximating the square function via a 2‑layer network  
  - Learning the product of two inputs  

- **Convergence rates in Sobolev spaces**  
  - Partition of unity approach for global approximation  
  - Sum‑product of local Taylor polynomials
