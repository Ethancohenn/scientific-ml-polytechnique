# PC8 â€“ Deep Operator Networks & Fourier Neural Operators

This notebook and presentation constitute the final project of *Machine Learning for Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis*. It covers two neural operator architectures for learning solution operators of PDEs, followed by course feedback.

## Topics Covered

- **Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets)**
  - Data generation for Gaussian and polynomial test functions
  - Implementation of branch and trunk networks
  - Training results on same and different datasets (RMSE, training time)

- **Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)**
  - 1D Fourier layer and full FNO architecture
  - Generation of training data on regular grids
