# Scientific Machine Learning — École Polytechnique

This repository contains the practical work I completed for the course *Machine Learning for Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis* (APM-52009-EP) taught by Dr. Hadrien Montanelli at École Polytechnique in 2025.

The course explores how modern machine learning methods, particularly neural networks, can be used to solve problems traditionally addressed through numerical analysis — such as PDEs, parameter estimation, and reduced-order modeling.

Each practical session includes a hands-on Jupyter notebook, and the final project includes a presentation of our results.

## Course Topics

- **Supervised Learning**
  - Least squares, Gauss–Newton, QR decomposition
  - Neural networks and backpropagation
  - Approximation theory (universality, Sobolev spaces)

- **Solving PDEs**
  - Classical methods: finite elements, finite differences
  - Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

- **Solving Parametric PDEs**
  - Reduced basis methods (SVD, Galerkin)
  - Neural operators: DeepONet, Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)
