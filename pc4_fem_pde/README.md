# PC4 – Finite Element Methods for PDEs

This set of three notebooks constitutes the fourth practical assignment of *Machine Learning for Scientific Computing and Numerical Analysis*. It develops P1 finite element techniques to approximate functions and solve both elliptic and parabolic PDEs in one spatial dimension.

## Topics Covered

1. **pc4-01_notebook.ipynb** – P1 FE basis & interpolation: hat functions, basis assembly, interpolation, error convergence  
2. **pc4-02_notebook.ipynb** – Elliptic PDEs: stiffness/load assembly, Dirichlet BCs, Poisson & general elliptic solve  
3. **pc4-03_notebook.ipynb** – Parabolic PDEs: FE discretization, time stepping (Forward/Backward Euler), spectrum & stability, Allen–Cahn
